# In order to test the some object defined in a class you can run:

python3 -m unittest tests.test_objects.test_permutations

unittest indicates that this library is to be ran as an script, so that the
  test will be in fact unitary.

tests.test_objects.test_permutations is simply the route where the program 
  to be run is to be found.
